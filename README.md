🏆 Hackathon Project by Team Liquid
This Inventory Management System is a web application designed by Team Liquid for GNDU (Guru Nanak Dev University). It streamlines inventory tracking, component management, and request approvals for university departments, labs, or student clubs.

Features
✅ User authentication with Clerk ✅ Role-based access control (Admin, Users) ✅ Track available, in-use, and requested inventory ✅ Issue and return inventory items ✅ Request approval system ✅ Modern and responsive UI

How It Works
User Authentication: Users log in with their university credentials via Clerk.

Role-Based Access:

Admins can manage the full inventory, approve requests, and modify stock.

Users (e.g., students, faculty) can view and request inventory.

Inventory Management:

Users can see real-time stock levels.

Admins can update stock, add new items, and track issued components.

Request & Approval Flow:

Users request items they need.

Admins receive, approve, or reject requests in a dashboard.

Issued items are tracked until they are returned.

Technologies Used
